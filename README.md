# USB-Microscope-Dial-Indicator-Adapter

This is an adapter that will allow the standard USB Microscope ![USB Microscope](/Microscope.jpg) to be fit into a standard dial indicator mount.

I use this as a handy rigid articulating arm for inspecting small components on PCBs. 

This was created using FreeCad with the intention of being printed on my Ender 3 Pro Printer.
